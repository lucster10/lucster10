### - Hello there random internet person -
I'm a fourth year computer science student at Queens University! 

Some of the languages I excel at are: Python, Java, C#, Javascript, GML, Haskell, Prolog, and Pascal (Thanks CISC 458)

If I'm being entirely honest, I'm writing this at 4am after realizing I don't have a readme on my github page so I'll skip the wordplay and get to the point:

ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence - I specialize in AI! While I still have a long ways to go, I've had a blast getting familiar implementing models from various branches of machine learning over the past few years.

üïπÔ∏è Game Design - Possibly my biggest passion is game design. Over the last half-a-decade, I've continued to improve my skills across various game engines such as Unity, Godot and Gamemaker.

I'm gonna add more to this readme in the morning but for the time being, here's a picture of a Westie that according to google image search, has a creative commons license.

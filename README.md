### Hi!
I'm a fourth year computer science student at Queens University! Some of the languages I excel at are: Python, Java, C#, Javascript, GML, Haskell, Prolog, and Pascal. (Thanks CISC 458)

I specialize in AI and have a passion for game development. 

This is [my resum√©]("https://lucster10.github.io/resume/Lucas-Patoine-Resume-2024.pdf"){:target="_blank"} and here's a photo of my dog Stanley!
